# MPI for image filtering

Created for the University of Cape Town (EEE4020F Practical 3)

This program tests the MPI parallel programming functionality by reading in an image and applying a median smoothing filter algorithm to the components in parallel.
For experimentation purposes, the speedup of the parallelized algorithm to the serial algorithm is recorded.
